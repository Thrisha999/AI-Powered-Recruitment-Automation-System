# AI-Powered Recruitment Automation System

## üöÄ Overview

This project is built for the hackathon challenge **"Enhancing Job Screening with AI and Data Intelligence"**. It automates the end-to-end recruitment pipeline using a **multi-agent AI system** powered by NLP and long-term memory. The system reads and summarizes job descriptions, extracts structured data from CVs, matches candidate profiles, shortlists qualified candidates, and sends personalized interview requests.
